In this project I have calculated Air Quality Index(AQI) of a particular city in India based on the chemical constituents found in the air. 
Data cleaning (dealing with missing values and outlier treatment) is done in Python. 
Also some exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to see if geographic locations of different cities, timeline (year) and climatic conditions are affecting the air quality.
Then 'SelectKBest' method is applied to find the significant features in the dataset. 
A few regression techniques like LinearRegression, OLS estimators, GLS estimators, RandomForestRegressor are applied on the dataset.

Here, I have uploaded the python Jupyter notebook file, python (.py) file and csv file.
